 * See /src for code (with subfolders for different project sections). 
 * See /data for game content (see files in /design for information on how that content is to be written). Some content will need to be written in Java for custom behavior, but most of the content should be able to be written in a plaintext format and parsed.
 * See /docs for design specifications (including how to write game content files), planning documents, etc.
