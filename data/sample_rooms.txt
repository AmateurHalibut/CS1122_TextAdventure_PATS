description>This is a large room which seems to be air-conditioned. In one corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes dryer.

description>On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in a dialect of Swahili. Fortunately, I know this dialect and the label translates to START. The switch does not appear to be manipulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4 inch). 

description>On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is [if the machine is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].</description>
